Welcome to my Linux dotfiles repository. The terminal in the screenshot above is from WSL but the colorscheme [gruvbox](https://github.com/YV31/gruvbox-css) and the font [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) can be applied in putty, xterm, etc.

## Overview

The triumvirate that enables a powerful terminal workflow consists of zsh, tmux and vim. From left to right the tmux bar indicates name of session, user, window/plane indices, windows, time, date, and hostname. The [Powerline](https://github.com/jimeh/tmux-themepack) themepack repo needs to be pulled and configured in the .tmux.conf file as indicated.
